Linked List Overview:

Linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations
Elements are linked using pointers (references to the next node)
Consists of nodes, each node contains data and a reference to the next node
Head pointer points to the first node, tail pointer points to the last node

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next node
Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to the next and previous nodes
Circular Linked List: Last node points back to the head node

Advantages:

Dynamic size (easy insertion and deletion)
Efficient memory utilization (no need to pre-allocate memory)
Insertion and deletion at the beginning are O(1) operations

Disadvantages:

No random access (need to traverse from the start)
More memory overhead (additional pointers)
Accessing/Searching is O(n) operation

Basic Operations:

Insertion (at beginning, end, or middle)
Deletion (at beginning, end, or middle)
Traversal (linear search)
Finding length
